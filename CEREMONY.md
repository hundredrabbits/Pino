# The Ceremony

"Mighty Neptune, king of all that moves on the waves, and mighty Aeolus, guardian of the winds, we ask that, in the name of all who have sailed aboard this boat in the past, and in the name of all who may sail aboard her in the future, we invoke your favour with these blessings today".

"We offer you our thanks for the protection you have afforded this vessel in the past"

"That the name whereby this vessel has hitherto been known *Irish Whiskey* be struck & removed from your records".

## The re-dedication

"We re-dedicate this vessel to your domain in full knowledge that she will be subject, as always, to the immutable laws of the ancient gods of the wind and the sea. We name this boat PINO. May she bring fair winds, safe passages and good fortune to all who sail on her"

## The Libation

"We seal this pact with a libation offered according to the ritual of the sea".
