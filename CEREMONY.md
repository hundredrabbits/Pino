# The Ceremony

## The invocation

"Mighty Neptune, king of all that moves on the waves, and mighty Aeolus, guardian of the winds, we ask that, in the name of all who have sailed aboard this boat in the past, and in the name of all who may sail aboard her in the future, we invoke your favour with these blessings today".

## The expression of gratitude

"We offer you our thanks for the protection you have afforded this vessel in the past"

## The supplication

"That the name whereby this vessel has hitherto been known (speak the old name here) be struck & removed from your records".

## The re-dedication

"We re-dedicate this vessel to your domain in full knowledge that she will be subject, as always, to the immutable laws of the ancient gods of the wind and the sea. I name this boat" (insert the name here) "May she bring fair winds, safe passages and good fortune to all who sail on her"

## The Libation

"We seal this pact with a libation offered according to the ritual of the sea". Now the champagne! Smash the bottle over the bow (put it in a fine net bag first so no-one cuts their feet on the glass shards in the water), or pour the champagne over the bow. It's important that you use the whole bottle... no cheating & tasting a little. The WHOLE bottle!
