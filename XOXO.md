## Talk

### 1 The Setup

Living and working from a sailboat as we travel around the world, making open source tools and games.

We are digital nomads, living aboard a sailboat. Since February 2016, we have sailed 28'810km through 11 countries, making open-source tools, games, recipes, and videos. We embarked in this lifestyle experiment to stay creative, and to reduce our impact on the world.

- 1.1 **Intro**, together we make games, books, tools and toys â€” On the ocean.
- 1.2 **Pino**, our home and studio, spaceship.
- 1.3 **Learn**, but we knew nothing about nothing. Parental disbelief.
- 1.4 **Trip** We wanted to stay put, but Wanderlust. Margaritas, then suddenly Japan. Sucked into a 5 years adventure. Inertia. 

### 2 The Conflict

A collection of moments on the joys and difficulties of living away from internet and power.

- 2.1 **Downsizing**, from our appartment in Tokyo to a 10m x 2m sailboat. It's not that hard.
- 2.2 **Buying a sailboat**, learning to sail. It's not that hard. Sailboat repairs, the sailing community, open-source philosophy.
- 2.3 **Development** without reliable internet connection (Nuku hiva, outdoor cafe, bugs, slow internet, especially when the cruiseship arrives etc). It's pretty hard. When Itchio lent us a hand. Meeting with another iOS developer on an island, iOS Troubles. Because of power issues (2 macbooks), couldn't charge them on end, and so couldnt work with applications like photoshop or Xcode, tools we thought necessary.
- 2.4 **The Weather**, the sun and wind (swinging away from internet hotspot in huahine) dictate our tasks, lack of power. Sea sickness, staying safe, preparedness, wind changes.

### 3 The Resolution

- 3.1 **Lessons**, learning new things again. Learning = Growth Work less, due to solar power. Make different items choices, what works on land won't necessarily work on a boat (computers, corrosion etc). Durability, simplicity and multi-functional.
- 3.2 **Counciencious living**, exit the loop of buy/sell when moving. Own less, be more mobile. One thing enters, one leaves. Lifestyle experiment. Digital nomads, Solarpunk values.
- 3.3 **Lightweight content** in an age of bloated internet. We couldn't make a video game, so we made a book. Changing our habits, and projects.
