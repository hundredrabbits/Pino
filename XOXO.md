## Talk

### The Setup

Living and working from a sailboat as we travel around the world, making open source tools and games.

- Intro, together we make games, books, tools and toys â€” On the ocean.
- This is Pino, our home and studio, spaceship.
- We wanted to stay put, but Wanderlust. Margaritas, then suddenly Japan.
  - Sucked into a 5 years adventure. Inertia.
- But we knew nothing about nothing.
- Discovering youtube sailing channels, "What, you can do that?!".
- Parental disbelief.

### The Conflict

A collection of moments on the joys and difficulties of living away from internet and power.

- Downsizing from our appartment in Tokyo to a 10m x 2m sailboat.
  - It's not that hard.
- Buying a boat, learning to sail.
  - It's not that hard.
  - Sailboat repairs, the sailing community, open-source philosophy.
- Development without reliable internet connection.
  - It's pretty hard.
  - When Itchio lent us a hand.
  - Meeting with another iOS developer on an island, iOS Troubles.
- The Weather
  - Sun dictates our tasks, lack of power.
  - Sea sickness, staying safe, preparedness, wind changes.

### The Resolution

- Learning new things again.
  - Lessons = Learning = Growth
  - Work less, due to solar power.
- More counciencious living:
  - Exit the loop of buy/sell when moving.
  - Own less, be more mobile. One thing enters, one leaves.
  - Lifestyle experiment  
  - Digital nomads, Solarpunk values  
- Publishing lightweight content in an age of bloated internet.
  - We couldn't make a video game, so we made a book.
  - Changing our habits, and projects.
